# Building Agentic AI Application In Snowflake

## Overview

In this guide, you'll learn how to build a Data Agent using Snowflake Cortex AI that can intelligently respond to questions by reasoning over both structured and unstructured data.

We'll use a custom dataset focused on bikes and skis. This dataset is intentionally artificial, ensuring that no external LLM has prior knowledge of it. This gives us a clean and controlled environment to test and evaluate our data agent. By the end of the session, you'll have a working AI-powered agent capable of understanding and retrieving insights across diverse data types â€” all securely within Snowflake.
